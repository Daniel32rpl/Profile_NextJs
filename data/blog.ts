      The event loop is a fundamental part of Node.js that enables non-blocking I/O operations. It allows Node.js to perform 
      asynchronous tasks and handle multiple operations concurrently on a single thread.

      Key Concepts:
      - Callbacks
      - Promises and Async/Await
      - Phases of the Event Loop

      By understanding the event loop, you can write more efficient and optimized back-end applications using Node.js.
